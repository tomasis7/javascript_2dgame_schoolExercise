Acknowledgments
Thanks to the school for providing the opportunity to work on this project.

Inspired by AI GitHub Copilot and the image generator Canva. At least 80% of the code is written by myself, though the code became very long because of my simple way of coding. Copilot suggested various ideas to shorten the code, but it became impossible since 1000 lines of the code were already done. I learned a lot and would write it differently the next time.
